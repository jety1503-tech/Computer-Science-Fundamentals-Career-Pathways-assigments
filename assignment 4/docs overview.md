# Project Overview
This project is a static portfolio website that showcases basic HTML and CSS skills. It includes sections for personal information, projects, skills, and contact links.

## Development Process
1. Planned the sections: header, hero, about, projects, skills, and contact.
2. Created the HTML structure using semantic tags like `header`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`.
3. Styled the page with CSS, focusing on layout, colors, spacing, and simple responsiveness.
4. Used VS Code to edit and preview the files in the browser.
5. Tracked changes with Git and pushed the repository to GitHub.

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed project cards with images and links.
- Improve responsiveness for very small screens.
- Add a dark mode toggle using CSS and JavaScript.
- Connect a real back-end for the contact section.
